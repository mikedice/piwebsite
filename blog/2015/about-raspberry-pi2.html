                    <p>I've been writing a lot of posts lately on social media about my Raspberry Pi computers. I recently acquired two of these devices and my excitement about them has grown quickly. So, I decided to write a series of posts about my experience with these devices and some of the applications for them that I've come up with. There is already a ton of information about Raspberry Pi on the internet too and it is all easy to find using a search in your favorite search engine. So, if you don't get what you are looking for from my posts have no fear because there is a high chance of finding it on the web.</p>
                    <p>Here are some notes about my recent experiences working with my Raspberry Pi 2 computer. I purchased a Pi for myself about a month ago. The Raspberry Pi platform has been around for a few years now but I haven't taken the time to really look at them until recently. Fortunately for me when I bought my first one the Raspberry Pi 2 had been released which really has some pretty impressive hardware specs. So what is it? Well instead of me describing it all over again I'll just include here a quote from the folks at the Raspberry Pi foundation:</p>

                                The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It's capable of doing everything you'd expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.
                            What's more, the Raspberry Pi has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.

                    <p>I paid $40 for my first Raspberry Pi. I bought it directly from an electronics store near where I live but they are easy to find online too. And for $40, look at the impressive hardware you get</p>
